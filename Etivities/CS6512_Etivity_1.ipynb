Please, consult the lectures of Week #10 for more details on how we determine the components of a linear/non-linear programming problem and also, how we implement linear/non-linear programs in Python. The program you are going to implement is based on a real-life scenario, which is invented by the author of this assignment and thus, the numbers provided are fictive.\n",

        "Mazda Motor Corporation produces three models of its CX series: Mazda CX-3, Mazda CX-5, and Mazda CX-9 (for simplicity, in this scenario we ignore the new models like CX-30, CX-50, etc.). Market projections indicate an expected monthly demand of at least: 3500 cars of the CX-3 model, 5000 cars of the CX-5 model, and 2100 cars of the CX-9 model.  Due to insufficient production capacity, no more than 4000 cars can be made of model CX-3, no more than 7000 cars can be made of model CX-5, and no more than 2500 cars can be made of model CX-9. Due to existing contracts with car dealers worldwide, a total of at least 12000 cars must be produced each month. Here is the financial result calculated as production costs â€“ selling costs per model:\n",
